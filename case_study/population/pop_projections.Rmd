Dependency ratios express the sizes of specific demographic groups relative to the rest of the population. Generally high dependency ratios imply that more individuals are consuming services. Therefore, increases in the ratio over time have singificant implications for public policy and funding.

Two particular ratios are important for Provincial policy:

- Children - anyone age `r child_threshold` or less
- Seniors - anyone age `r senior_threshold` or more

Population projections to `r max(demographics$Year)` from the Ministry of Finance show trends in these two ratios over time.

```{r, plots, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(demographics, aes(x = Year, y = Ratio, group = Type, colour = Type))
p + geom_line() + labs(title = "Projected dependency ratios")
```

Although the child ratio is declining moderately over time, the senior ratio rises dramatically from `r round(min(demographics$Ratio[demographics$Type=="Senior_Dependency"]), 2)` to `r round(max(demographics$Ratio[demographics$Type=="Senior_Dependency"]), 2)`.
